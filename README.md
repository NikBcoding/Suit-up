#Suited & Booted

ABOUT

*Suited and Booted is a simple and fun app that can help users either pick out an outfit to wear, or give them ideas of what they might want to buy.

*Users will be able to select any type of outfit style(EX: business, casual, beach...) and from each outfit style, users will be able to select and change colors to each individual type of clothing. 

*This can help users get an idea of what outfit they would like to wear before going though their entire closet looking for an outfit to wear.

*This can also give the user an easier time to pick out an outfit they would want to buy, by simply seeing what colors go well with each other.

*Users don't need to be signed up, in order to play around with outfits and the color picker.  

*Only if users decide to save their created outfits for future reference they will be required to be signed up / logged in.

FUTURE GOALS
	
	My future goals for this app is to include more outfit styles, more colors, add different background settings so that users can have an idea of what they might look like at a specific location.  I would want to make it more user friendly and style it up as I move forward with it.
